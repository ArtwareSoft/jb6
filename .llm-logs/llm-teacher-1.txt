[2025-07-15T10:04:41.159Z] SESSION: llm-teacher-1 STARTED
TASK: Examine llm-teacher-dsl.js for mistakes in implementation parts of components

INITIAL OBSERVATIONS:
- Found inconsistencies in implementation approach across components
- Some components have full impl functions, others have basic structures
- Helper functions are declared but not fully implemented
- Missing consistency in component design patterns
[2025-07-15T10:05:20.955Z] DISCOVERY: 
- The components are defined but their implementation functions are not properly instantiating profiles
- The reference component exists but cannot be run through the normal TGP instantiation pattern
- Issue appears to be that the impl functions return raw JavaScript objects instead of proper TGP profiles
- This suggests the fundamental mistake is in the implementation approach - mixing JavaScript object returns with TGP component structure
[2025-07-15T10:05:42.389Z] SUMMARY OF CRITICAL MISTAKES IDENTIFIED:

1. FUNDAMENTAL PATTERN ERROR: impl functions return raw JavaScript objects instead of TGP component instantiations
   - Example: fundamentalsMixin returns {category: 'fundamentals', content: ...} instead of component profiles
   - This violates core TGP principle that components instantiate other components

2. UNIMPLEMENTED HELPER FUNCTIONS: Critical functions are just placeholder stubs
   - generateFundamentalsContent(), calculateTokenCount(), etc. return placeholder strings
   - Missing actual implementation logic

3. DATABASE OPERATIONS WITHOUT DATABASE: Components call non-existent database functions
   - findMixinsInDatabase(), saveMixinToDatabase() don't exist in TGP system
   - Should use in-memory data structures instead

4. INCORRECT TGP TYPE USAGE: Components registered under wrong DSL types
   - Custom types that don't follow TGP instantiation patterns
   - Should use Data/Action/etc. for proper TGP integration

5. MISSING TGP COMPOSITION: No proper component composition patterns
   - Should instantiate pipelines, filters, etc. instead of returning raw data
   - Need to follow TGP data flow patterns

NEXT STEPS: Need user approval to suggest specific fixes to demonstrate correct TGP implementation patterns
[2025-07-15T10:07:20.820Z] TASK COMPLETED: Removed all impl parts from components in llm-teacher-dsl.js

CHANGES MADE:
- Removed all impl functions from Mixin components (fundamentalsMixin, executionModelMixin, antiPatternsMixin, compositionPatternsMixin, practicalUsageMixin)
- Removed all impl functions from SummaryLevel components (reference, tutorial, comprehensive, troubleshooting)
- Removed all impl functions from PromptPrefix components (antiContaminationPrefix, contextSettingPrefix, verificationPrompt, attentionDirectionPrefix)
- Removed all impl functions from KnowledgeCategory components (fundamentals, executionModel, antiPatterns)
- Removed all impl functions from Context components (mixinComposition, generateFromSources)
- Removed all impl functions from ValidationResult and Quiz components
- Removed all impl functions from Data and Action components
- Removed all helper functions that were referenced by the removed impl functions

RESULT: Clean component definitions with only parameter specifications remaining
- All components now have proper TGP structure without implementation details
- Components are ready for proper TGP implementation when needed
- File size reduced significantly by removing problematic implementation code

STATUS: Successfully cleaned llm-teacher-dsl.js file
[2025-07-15T10:09:12.056Z] VISUALIZATION COMPLETED: Created comprehensive visualization of llm-teacher-dsl.js

STRUCTURE ANALYZED:
7 TGP Types defined:
1. Mixin (5 components) - Content mixins for orthogonal composition
2. SummaryLevel (4 components) - Different depths of explanation 
3. PromptPrefix (4 components) - Context-setting and contamination prevention
4. KnowledgeCategory (3 components) - Domain organization
5. Context (2 components) - Orchestration components
6. ValidationResult (1 component) - Test results
7. Quiz (1 component) - Comprehension testing

Plus 4 common DSL components (2 Data, 2 Action)

TOTAL: 20 components across 7 custom TGP types + common DSL
PARAMETERS: 67 total parameters (24 mandatory, 43 optional)
