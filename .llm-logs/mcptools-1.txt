MCP Tools Source Code Analysis - Issues Found
=====================================================

CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. VARIABLE SCOPE PROBLEMS in replaceFileSection:
   - `repoRoot` and `filePath` are destructured AFTER being used in `pathJoin(repoRoot, filePath)`
   - Line: `const fullPath = pathJoin(repoRoot, filePath)` comes BEFORE the destructuring
   - This causes "Cannot access 'repoRoot' before initialization" error

2. SAME ISSUE in appendToFile:
   - `const fullPath = pathJoin(repoRoot, filePath)` comes before destructuring
   - Variables used before they're declared

3. DYNAMIC PARAMETER HANDLING:
   - .profile access for dynamic parameters (newSectionText.profile, content.profile)
   - This might be causing issues if the framework doesn't properly handle dynamic params

4. INCONSISTENT PATH JOINING:
   - getFilesContent uses: `pathJoin(repoRoot, filePath.trim())`
   - saveToFile uses: `join(repoRoot, filePath)` (imports path.join)
   - Others use: `pathJoin(repoRoot, filePath)` 
   - Should be consistent

5. MISSING DESCRIPTION in saveToFile:
   - Other tools have descriptions, saveToFile doesn't

FIXES NEEDED:
1. Move variable destructuring BEFORE usage in replaceFileSection and appendToFile
2. Ensure consistent path joining across all tools
3. Add proper error handling for dynamic parameter access
4. Add description to saveToFile tool
5. Consider if .profile access is the correct way to handle dynamic params

The git-related tools (tgpModel, runSnippet, dslDocs) likely have working directory issues in their implementation files.
