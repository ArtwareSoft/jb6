[2025-07-07T06:51:20.782Z] Session mcptools-2 started - Testing refactored MCP tools with Shaiby
Starting with listRepoFiles test
[2025-07-07T06:51:33.171Z] ‚úÖ SUCCESS: listRepoFiles test passed
- Successfully listed 166 files totaling 5.41 MB
- Function correctly shows file paths and sizes
- Properly respects .gitignore patterns
- Output format is clean and readable
[2025-07-07T06:52:29.748Z] Starting learnCommonDsl implementation task
- Getting TGP model for packages/common/common-tests.js
- Reading tgp-primer.js and common-llm-guide.js
- Will implement learnCommonDsl following methodology with turn batching
[2025-07-07T06:52:47.181Z] ‚úÖ SUCCESS: Retrieved required files for learnCommonDsl
- tgp-primer.js: Comprehensive TGP concepts with concrete examples (2634 tokens)
- common-llm-guide.js: Common DSL learning framework with structured methodology (3188 tokens)
- Found learnCommonDsl doclet with 7-step procedural learning approach
- Noted TGP model retrieval failed (git repository issue) but proceeding with file-based approach
[2025-07-07T06:53:06.786Z] ‚ùå ISSUE: Git repository detection problem in runSnippets
- All snippet executions failing with "fatal: not a git repository" error
- This is affecting the learning implementation process
- Need to investigate if this is MCP tools configuration issue or environment problem
[2025-07-07T06:53:28.693Z] üîç INVESTIGATION: runSnippet failure analysis
- Issue: MCP tools call coreUtils.runSnippetCli() which uses git commands internally
- Problem: /home/shaiby/projects/jb6 is not a git repository
- Need to either: 1) Initialize git repo, 2) Find alternate snippet execution method, 3) Modify tools to work without git
- This is blocking the learnCommonDsl implementation methodology
