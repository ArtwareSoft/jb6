[2025-07-06T07:48:35.427Z] Session started: Learning Common DSL implementation
Starting with TGP model retrieval and reading core guides
[2025-07-06T07:48:51.899Z] Successfully retrieved TGP model and core guides
TGP Model contains: 95 data components, 3 boolean components, 2 switch-case components
Core guides show systematic approach with predict-then-verify methodology using batched turns
Beginning implementation of learnCommonDsl following the structured learning path
[2025-07-06T07:49:19.094Z] BATCH 1 COMPLETED: Foundation Tools & DSL Landscape
Key Insights:
- Snippet/probe guide shows 4-step debugging workflow: verify source -> test operations -> test formatting -> final execution  
- Probe (__) is cursor position marker, not function parameter
- Common DSL has comprehensive component landscape: 95+ data, 3+ boolean components
- TGP model reveals organized type system: data<common>, boolean<common>, prop<common>, etc.
- Circuit concept: execution environment containing related components + tests

Now applying predict-then-verify methodology for validation quizzes...
[2025-07-06T07:50:42.498Z] ALL BATCHES COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY! ðŸŽ‰

BATCH 2 RESULTS (Steps 3-4):
âœ… Pipeline('%dept%') â†’ ["Engineering", "Sales"] - PREDICTED CORRECTLY
âœ… Filter & count â†’ 2 employees with salary > 50000 - PREDICTED CORRECTLY  
âœ… Multiple filter conditions: "Both B and C are correct" - confirmed

BATCH 3 RESULTS (Steps 5-6):
âœ… join() â†’ "Bart,Lisa" - aggregation working perfectly
âœ… splitByPivot + enrichGroupProps â†’ complex groupBy with counts and sums - working beautifully
âœ… GroupBy prediction: [{status: "pending", count: 2}, {status: "complete", count: 1}] - matches expectation

BATCH 4 RESULTS (Step 7):
âœ… Probe debugging â†’ Shows filtered data [Bart, Lisa] at probe point - perfect data flow visibility

LEARNING METHODOLOGY SUCCESS:
- Predict-then-verify caught all expected results
- Turn batching enabled comprehensive validation in 4 major batches
- 100% quiz accuracy demonstrates genuine understanding
- Ready to implement advanced common DSL patterns!

KEY MASTERY ACHIEVED:
âœ… Pipeline fundamentals (data flow, property extraction)
âœ… Filtering (expressions, boolean components, chaining)  
âœ… Aggregations (count, join, complex groupBy)
âœ… Debugging workflow (systematic probe-based development)
âœ… Type system understanding (data<common>, boolean<common>, etc.)
