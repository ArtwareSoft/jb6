[2025-07-06T07:27:00.147Z] Session started: Learning Common DSL implementation
Starting with TGP model retrieval and documentation reading
[2025-07-06T07:27:16.393Z] Successfully retrieved TGP model and documentation
- TGP model loaded from common-tests.js 
- Read tgp-primer.js: comprehensive TGP concepts and patterns with working examples
- Read common-llm-guide.js: contains structured learning methodology for learnCommonDsl

Key insight: The learnCommonDsl doclet provides a PROCEDURAL SOLUTION with systematic learning steps using TURN BATCHING methodology. I need to implement this carefully following the predict-then-verify approach with MCP tools.
[2025-07-06T07:27:24.477Z] IMPLEMENTATION PHASE STARTED
Following the learnCommonDsl procedural solution methodology
Phase 1: BATCH PREPARATION - Reading all steps and preparing predictions
[2025-07-06T07:28:38.070Z] Step 1 RESULTS - Probe Learning Validation:

QUIZ VALIDATION RESULTS:
✅ Quiz 1: Proper probe syntax is `__` at cursor position, not inside variables  
❌ Quiz 1 CORRECTION: The documentation shows '%$people/__' but actual syntax is just __ as position marker

✅ Quiz 2: CORRECT! pipeline('%$people%', filter('%age% < 30'), __) shows data AFTER filtering
- BEFORE filter: shows full array [Homer, Bart, Lisa] 
- AFTER filter: shows filtered array [Bart, Lisa]

✅ Quiz 4: Systematic debugging starts with verifying data source

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Probe __ acts as a CURSOR POSITION, not a function parameter
- Probe results show data at that exact execution point with metadata
- circuitRes contains the actual data value
- visits shows execution counts (filter ran 3x, once per person)
- totalTime shows performance metrics

DEBUGGING WORKFLOW CONFIRMED:
1. Verify data source first 
2. Test each operation with probes
3. Test formatting/templates 
4. Final execution without probe
[2025-07-06T07:29:03.257Z] Step 2 RESULTS - DSL Landscape Understanding:

MAJOR TGP TYPES IN COMMON DSL IDENTIFIED:
✅ data<common> - Primary data processing components (pipeline, filter, count, join, etc.)
✅ boolean<common> - Logical operations (and, or, not, equals, etc.) 
✅ action<common> - Side effects (log, runActions, etc.)
✅ prop<common> - Object property definitions
✅ group-prop<common> - Grouping property calculations 
✅ switch-case<common> - Conditional logic components

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Common DSL has 100+ components organized by type
- Data components are the majority - processing, transforming, aggregating
- Boolean components enable conditional logic in filters/switches
- Action components handle side effects and logging
- aggregator:true property indicates components that work on entire arrays
- modifierId:"Aggregator" marks components that can be used in pipelines

COMPONENT ORGANIZATION PATTERNS:
- Each component has params with type constraints
- defaultValue:"%%?" means uses pipeline input by default
- dynamic:true allows runtime expressions
- as:"array" indicates array parameter types
- mandatory:true requires the parameter

This structure enables type-safe composition across the DSL!
[2025-07-06T07:29:44.787Z] BATCH EXECUTION RESULTS - Steps 3-7 Complete:

PIPELINE FUNDAMENTALS (Step 3):
✅ pipeline('%$people%', '%name%') → ["Homer","Bart","Lisa"] 
- Pipeline extracts property from each array item
- Data flows left to right through operations

FILTERING OPERATIONS (Step 4):  
✅ pipeline('%$people%', filter('%age% < 30'), '%name%') → ["Bart","Lisa"]
- Filter selects only items meeting condition
- Remaining items continue through pipeline

AGGREGATION OPERATIONS (Step 5):
✅ pipeline('%$people%', filter('%age% < 30'), count()) → 2
✅ pipeline('%$people%', filter('%age% < 30'), '%name%', join()) → "Bart,Lisa"  
- count() returns array length
- join() concatenates with default comma separator

ADVANCED GROUPBY (Step 6):
✅ splitByPivot('region') groups data by region property
✅ enrichGroupProps(group.count(), group.sum('amount')) adds calculations
Result: [{region:"North", items:[...], count:2, sum:250}, {region:"South", items:[...], count:1, sum:200}]

DEBUGGING WITH PROBES (Step 7):
✅ pipeline('%$people%', '%name%', __) → circuitRes: ["Homer","Bart","Lisa"] 
✅ pipeline('%$sales%', splitByPivot('region'), __) → circuitRes: grouped objects
- Probe shows data flow at exact cursor position
- visits shows execution counts and performance
- totalTime provides performance metrics

METHODOLOGY VALIDATION:
✅ Systematic predict-then-verify approach works
✅ Turn batching enables comprehensive learning 
✅ Probe debugging reveals internal data flow
✅ Type system ensures safe component composition
[2025-07-06T07:30:20.466Z] LEARNCOMMONDSL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

FINAL SUMMARY:
Successfully implemented the learnCommonDsl procedural solution following the exact methodology described in packages/common/common-llm-guide.js

METHODOLOGY EXECUTION:
✅ BATCH PREPARATION PHASE: Read all steps, prepared predictions, grouped MCP tools
✅ BATCH EXECUTION PHASE: Executed tool batches systematically, compared with predictions  
✅ QUIZ VALIDATION: Used scrambleText for answers, followed predict-then-verify methodology

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
1. **Probe Debugging Mastery**: __ acts as cursor position marker, shows data flow with metadata
2. **DSL Organization**: data<common>, boolean<common>, action<common> are main types  
3. **Pipeline Fundamentals**: Left-to-right data flow, property extraction, chaining operations
4. **Filtering & Aggregation**: filter() selects items, count()/join() aggregate results
5. **Advanced GroupBy**: splitByPivot() + enrichGroupProps() enable analytical processing
6. **Systematic Debugging**: Verify source → test operations → test formatting → final execution

TURN BATCHING SUCCESS:
- Executed multiple learning steps per turn using runSnippets() 
- Validated multiple concepts simultaneously
- Maximized learning per interaction while maintaining rigorous methodology

FRAMEWORK INSIGHTS:
- TGP type system ensures safe cross-DSL composition
- Probe debugging is essential for development workflow  
- Common DSL provides comprehensive data processing foundation
- Procedural learning with validation prevents passive absorption

The predict-then-verify methodology with turn batching proved highly effective for systematic DSL mastery!
