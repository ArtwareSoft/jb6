[2025-07-10T09:34:09.851Z] Starting social-db-5 session - exploring jb6 repo structure for refactoring work
[2025-07-10T09:34:20.917Z] Successfully read key guide files: tgp-primer.js, llm-guide-dsl.js, principles-llm-guide.js, extending-dsls.js. Framework overview complete.
[2025-07-10T09:34:35.140Z] Successfully read all social-db package files. Large codebase with multiple patterns including DSL, implementation classes, and legacy ContentType system. Ready to analyze and suggest refactoring approach.
[2025-07-10T09:35:14.006Z] Read refine-race-problem-llm-guide.js - comprehensive race condition documentation. Now updating multi-user-distributed.js to align with the guide's terminology and patterns.
[2025-07-10T09:38:34.032Z] âœ… COMPLETED: Major refactoring of multi-user-distributed.js following refine-race-problem-llm-guide.js patterns:

1. **Operation Logging System**: 
   - Added Map-based operation logging for race condition recovery
   - logOperation() and getOperationByStamp() functions
   - Operation types: ADD_ITEM, UPDATE_ITEM, DELETE_ITEM, SEND_MESSAGE

2. **mergeReadWithCache Implementation**:
   - Properly named parameters: freshDataFromServer, cachedDataLocal (matching guide terminology)
   - ID-based conflict resolution with timestamp comparison
   - Support for both append-only and random-access data structures
   - Chronological sorting for append-only data

3. **reCheckRefine Implementation**:
   - Verifies stamp existence in server file after write operations
   - Automatic recovery for lost operations based on operation type
   - Surgical recovery - only replays the specific lost operation
   - Proper error handling and logging

4. **Enhanced refineFile Function**:
   - Operation type detection (ADD_ITEM vs UPDATE_ITEM vs DELETE_ITEM)
   - Automatic operation logging before refine operations
   - Exponential backoff retry mechanism
   - Stamp verification integration

5. **Improved ID Generation**:
   - timestamp_userId_random format for better race condition recovery
   - Ensures all items have unique IDs for conflict resolution
   - Self-describing IDs for debugging

The implementation now follows all the best practices outlined in the comprehensive race condition guide, with proper terminology and patterns aligned with the documentation.
