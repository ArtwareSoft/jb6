[2025-07-16T09:41:19.324Z] ERROR: First MCP tool call failed with "text is not defined" error. This suggests there might be an issue with the MCP service configuration or the tool itself. Will try individual file reads to troubleshoot.
[2025-07-16T09:41:28.402Z] ERROR: Individual file read also fails with "text is not defined" error. This appears to be a systematic issue with the MCP service getFilesContent tool. Will try alternative approach to read files.
[2025-07-16T09:43:36.289Z] ERROR: getFilesContent returning [object Promise] instead of file content. This suggests the MCP service is not properly awaiting the file read operation. Need to investigate if this is a known issue with the MCP implementation.
