[2025-07-06T11:14:27.078Z] Session whatup-2 started - exploring jb6 repo structure and DSL
[2025-07-06T11:14:46.219Z] Successfully loaded DSL documentation and guides - TGP primer shows component system, common DSL provides data processing, WhatsApp guide demonstrates LLM-ETL patterns
[2025-07-06T11:15:44.071Z] SUCCESS: Created comprehensive global profile for incremental DB search with TGP components, data flow diagrams, and implementation strategy. Profile includes change detection, semantic enrichment, search indexing, and cost optimization using jb6's component system.
[2025-07-06T11:20:45.873Z] INSIGHT: splitToGroups with overlap is key for LLM batch processing - ensures semantic continuity across boundaries
[2025-07-06T11:22:35.419Z] ENHANCEMENT: Updated profile with comprehensive splitToGroups implementation including semantic boundary detection, overlap resolution strategies, context preservation, and cost optimization for overlapping batches
