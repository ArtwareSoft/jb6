[2025-07-14T13:12:13.630Z] PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: howToConductResearch doesn't follow llm-guide DSL principles - missing explicit problem() statement and doesn't emphasize step 1 as immediate interactive requirement. Need to fix to prevent LLMs from skipping definition phase.
[2025-07-14T13:14:54.268Z] SUCCESS: Fixed howToConductResearch guidance in packages/mcp/mcp-research.js
- Added proper problem() statement
- Made step 1 explicit as immediate interactive requirement
- Added doNot() anti-pattern for assuming parameters
- Followed 75% word reduction principle
- Added missing llm-guide DSL imports
This should prevent LLMs from skipping the definition phase in future research tasks.
