Task: Implement learnCommonDsl from packages/common/common-llm-guide.js
Requirements: 
- DO NOT change fw code, docs and test files without consultation
- Use TURN BATCHING
- Follow methodology and do all quizes
- Read tgp-primer.js and common-llm-guide.js carefully
- Get common dsl using tgpModel(packages/common/common-tests.js)
[2025-07-17T06:20:17.160Z] Starting common DSL course session
- Repository structure explored successfully
- Found key files: packages/core/llm-guide/tgp-primer.js, packages/llm-guide/principles-llm-guide.js, packages/common/common-llm-guide.js
- Next: Reading TGP primer and principles guide
[2025-07-17T06:24:38.471Z] Error: tgpModel response too large (53690 tokens > 25000 limit)
- Need to use pagination or filtering to get common DSL model
- This suggests the TGP model is quite comprehensive
[2025-07-17T09:45:53.278Z] Starting common DSL course session. Goal: Learn and implement common DSL methodology following tgp-primer and common-llm-guide.js

- Instructions: Do not change fw code, docs and test files without consultation
- Goal: Implement learnCommonDsl methodology with quizzes and turn batching
[2025-07-17T10:19:18.653Z] SUCCESS: MCP tools working via JSON-RPC interface
- tgpModel tool successfully retrieved common DSL model
- Found comprehensive TGP model with data, boolean, action types
- Available data components: pipeline, filter, count, join, toUpperCase, etc.
- Ready to implement learnCommonDsl 7-step methodology

Starting Step 1: Master runSnippet and probe debugging...
[2025-07-17T10:21:07.743Z] Step 1 COMPLETED: Master runSnippet and probe debugging
✅ Successfully understood snippet execution model
✅ Mastered probe (__) placement in variable expressions: '%$people/__%'
✅ Verified probe placement in pipelines: pipeline(..., __)
✅ Probe correctly shows filtered data: [{name: "Bart", age: 12}, {name: "Lisa", age: 10}]
✅ Probe shows complete people array: [{name: "Homer", age: 42}, {name: "Bart", age: 12}, {name: "Lisa", age: 10}]
✅ Understood 4-step debugging workflow: 1) verify source, 2) test operations, 3) test formatting, 4) final execution

Moving to Step 2: Understand DSL landscape and component organization...
