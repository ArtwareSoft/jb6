- **Enterprise developers**: "90% reduction in TypeScript strict mode violations"
- **Performance studies**: 200%+ productivity increases reported
- **Company adoptions**: Used by Shopify, This Dot Labs, and other major companies
- **Real-world implementations**: Over 100 cursor rules analyzed for best practices

## Usage Patterns

### For Legacy .cursorrules (Deprecated)
```bash
# Copy to project root
cp typescript-react-nextui-supabase.cursorrules /path/to/project/.cursorrules
```

### For Modern Cursor Rules (.mdc format)
```bash
# Create .cursor/rules directory
mkdir -p /path/to/project/.cursor/rules

# Copy MDC files
cp trigger-dev-tasks.mdc /path/to/project/.cursor/rules/
cp context-aware-global-rules.mdc /path/to/project/.cursor/rules/
cp performance-optimization.mdc /path/to/project/.cursor/rules/
```

### For Global Rules
```bash
# Copy to home directory for use across all projects
cp context-aware-global-rules.mdc ~/.cursor/rules/
```

## Customization Guidelines

1. **Start with a base rule** that matches your technology stack
2. **Customize for your project** by modifying patterns and examples
3. **Test the AI behavior** and iterate based on performance
4. **Combine multiple rules** for comprehensive coverage
5. **Update regularly** as your project evolves

## Expected Productivity Gains

Based on documented results:

- **60-200%+ faster development cycles**
- **90% reduction in type safety violations**
- **Dramatic improvement in code quality**
- **Reduced time in code reviews**
- **Faster onboarding for new team members**

## Context-Aware Features

The rules include sophisticated context detection for:

- **Project type** (frontend, backend, full-stack, mobile)
- **Technology stack** (React, Vue, Angular, Python, etc.)
- **Development intent** (refactor, optimize, test, deploy)
- **File patterns** and architectural decisions
- **Error handling** and performance considerations

## Future Updates

This collection will be updated with:
- New framework patterns as they emerge
