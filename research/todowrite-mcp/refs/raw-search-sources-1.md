We examined the media used to record and organize to-dos and tracked how tasks are completed over time. Our work shows that, contrary to popular wisdom, people are not poor at prioritizing. Rather, they have well-honed strategies for tackling particular task management challenges. By illustrating what factors influence task completion and how representations function to support task management, we hope to provide a strong foundation for the design of a personal to-do list manager. We also present some preliminary efforts in this direction. TaskVista: a personal task list manager component. ... Content may be subject to copyright. ... Content may be subject to copyright.

This method dynamically adjusts sample and task weights during training to effectively prioritize more challenging tasks, where task difficulty is inversely proportional to performance and evolves throughout the training process. Experiments on both public and private datasets have demonstrated that the accuracy of our method surpasses the existing state-of-the-art methods in both single segmentation task and in the detection and segmentation multi-task. Our approach achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time surgical guidance applications. ...

. A simple pilot study has been undertaken to investigate the use of 'personal information management technologies' (including both traditional and emerging electronic technologies) via a combination of nominal questionnaire and semi-structured interview schedules. The pilot study suggested that the number of users adopting computer-based personal information management technologies is low, as is the combination of computer-based technologies with traditional paper-based technologies in users' 'personal information management systems'. ... We have already begun to read 'through' the narrator's discourse and to form a view of the events which differs from the one intended and 'represented' by him. That is, we have tried to abstract 'real events' from the personal inflection of values and to judge them, so far as possible, independently of the narrator's guidance — an analysis which the bona fide (and impersonal) representation of a ...

One primary contribution of this paper is the set of task management tool attributes that we developed through brainstorming and a series of formative studies. These attributes can be used to evaluate existing task management tools from a particular perspective and understand the qualities users seek in them in future research. For example, Google Tasks is available "within a communication context" where a user can quickly turn an email into a task, though it allows users neither to specify "hierarchical" relationships between tasks nor to color-code tasks with "richly formatted" options. In addition, the six latent factors we identified provide a set of dimensions to characterize a particular tool in a way analogous to the Big Five personality traits [19, 31, 65]. These six latent factors could be further refined and validated using confirmatory factor analysis [37] so as to test the reliability of these factors.

The relationship between the six design factors and personality traits / job characteristics found in our analysis · With an increased emphasis on enhancing productivity, there have been developments in a significant number of task management tools. Each of these tools provides specific types of functionality at the cost of others. For instance, while paper-based tools are ideal for handling to-dos with convenience, editability, and portability, they lack the capability to address procrastination. Scholars have also been interested in how different tools support different functions, and how users utilize those functions to accomplish their purposes.

In this project, we investigated the attributes of task management tools and explored their relationships with internal and external factors. The contributions of this paper are: empirical knowledge on how task management tools fit into the work of knowledge workers' (e.g., tools used, frequency, mandated use, planning time window) a comprehensive list of task management tool attributes and their perceived importance · the six latent qualities knowledge workers look for in task management tools, as identified through exploratory factor analysis · the relationships between these latent qualities and workers' dynamics—personality traits and job characteristics · Below, we discuss these results and share the implications of our study's findings for future promising works. We noticed that participants reported using many task management tools at once; the average number of tools selected was approximately nine.

We conducted a series of analyses on our dataset to understand users' task management values and answer our research questions. We started by looking into general habits and perceptions related to task tracking among our participants before examining the latent factors that structure the attributes we identified with respect to task tracking and management tools. Finally, we explored the relationships between those latent attributes and the internal (Big 5 traits) and external factors (job characteristics, workload, and custom questions) we measured. We analyzed four primary aspects in this regard: the tracking tools respondents use, the frequency with which they check those tools, their planning time windows, which tools tend to be used (in)voluntarily, and respondents' satisfaction with the tools they use. ... This bar graph summarizes how many response counts and proportions for task management tools and methods that 248 participants use.

Subsequently, a matter-element extension model is utilized to quantify the risk factors within this index system, and comprehensive weights are determined using variable weight theory to assess construction risk levels. Importance analysis of each index is then conducted to identify those with significant impact on risk evaluation outcomes. Finally, by comparing actual engineering cases with other risk evaluation models, this paper verifies the reliability of its constructed risk assessment model and proposes measures for controlling potential risks based on these evaluations. The paper provides a clear definition of safety risks encountered during TBM construction and conducts comprehensive risk assessments as a valuable reference for research related to the tunnel boring machine construction period in tunnel engineering. ... ...

Analysis of Task Management in Virtual Academic Teams ... Social Collaboration Analytics (SCA) aims at measuring collaboration in Enterprise Collaboration Systems (ECS). In this paper, we apply SCA to investigate the use of Task Management (TM) features in virtual academic teams on a collaboration platform. This paper contributes to theory by developing the TM Catalog describing the elements and characteristics of TM. Our literature review identified only three studies analyzing the use of TM features in ECS. These studies base their analyses on transactional data (event logs). We propose to analyze both the structure and characteristics of tasks, as well as how tasks are used. In our paper, we show how SCA can be applied to gain insights on the use of TM features. Based on data from an academic collaboration platform, we demonstrate the characteristics of tasks and how different types of virtual academic teams make use of TM features.

The WBS forms the basis for many aspects of the project management process; similarly, the RBS can be used to structure and guide the risk management process. This paper presents the concept of the RBS, and gives a number of examples drawn from different project types and industries. Although not necessarily based in FM, the concepts and experience can be applied to any project. The benefits of using the RBS are then outlined, including as an aid for risk identification or risk assessment, comparison of projects, providing a framework for cross-project risk reporting, and structuring lessons to be learned for future projects. This paper shows how to use the RBS to gain these benefits. ... Liam J. Bannon ... Melissa L.

All the children were videotaped during non-interactive pre-test and post-test sessions (stages 1 and 4) and two types of interactive sessions: (1) novice children training with adults (stage 2); and (2) competent instruction by children, or competent children, interacting with novice children (stage 

Three particular dimensions of these interactive sessions have been studied: (1) making strategies explicit; (2) children's task management; and (3) modes of interaction and their evolution in the course of the task resolution. Through a qualitative case-based analysis of four dyads extracted from the experiment, the results highlight the plurality and complexity of the socio-cognitive dynamics in dyadic interactions. The discussion focuses on the processes of collaborative learning involved in such interactions. ...  6 Information Science, Personal Information Management, Task Management, Library and Information Studies · The success of international development projects, trust and communication: an African perspective · Project success is strongly linked to communication and cooperation between stakeholders.

They are often overused and simultaneously criticised for lacking means to prevent cognitive overload of the users and off-target value of the deployed software. Apparently, their value proposition does not cover the user needs for the management of personal communication, information and collaboration appropriately. Recently, several approaches towards Semantic Email handling have been proposed to ensure more efficient use of contextual information. Rather novel Semantic Task Management approaches have been considered to support break down of the personal workload in terms of information, communication and context management. In this paper, we propose to combine the strengths of semantic web technologies, email technology and task management. We base our research upon results obtained in the EU projects Nepomuk and Ecospace, and describe the synergies that result from the introduced combination.

" Task Matrix" helps teams to define the tasks using "Eisenhower matrix" and share it across easily and helps project management team and fellow team members to organize task effectively. Every project or event involves series of tasks, activities, people, budget and deadlines. No matter how big or small the project is, the success or failure of the project depends on the execution plan and the order in which the tasks are fulfilled. It takes a great deal of skill to do this well, the time invested in building good project management techniques can pay off enormously and helps to achieve projects on time within the resource constraints. When one knows how to organize, schedule and delegate tasks it is an easy step for them to obtain the success of the project. This is where Eisenhower decision matrix comes in to the picture. Currently, there is no system or tool to organize the project related tasks and segregate it on priority.
