# TodoWrite MCP Service Research Summary

## Research Overview
This research investigated TodoWrite functionality, task management systems, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementations to create a comprehensive task management service for jb6.

## Key Findings

### 1. TodoWrite in Claude Code
- **Core Functionality**: TodoWrite and TodoRead are essential task management tools in Claude Code
- **Schema**: Uses structured format with id, content, status, priority, timestamps, and metadata
- **Behavior**: TodoWrite replaces entire todo list (not append-only)
- **Status Types**: pending, in_progress, completed
- **Priority Levels**: high, medium, low
- **Persistence**: Maintains state across sessions

### 2. Task Management Research Insights
- **User Strategies**: People have well-honed strategies for task management, contrary to assumptions about poor prioritization
- **Tool Diversity**: Average users employ ~9 different task management tools simultaneously
- **Paper Persistence**: Paper-based tools account for 20-30% of task management across both work and personal contexts
- **Cross-boundary Management**: Important distinction between work and personal task contexts

### 3. MCP Implementation Patterns
- **FastMCP Framework**: Python SDK uses @mcp.tool() decorators for exposing functionality
- **Persistent Storage**: Modern MCP servers support persistent context across sessions
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Advanced implementations use graph structures for entity relationships
- **Client-Server Architecture**: MCP follows standardized client-server communication patterns

### 4. AI Task Management Evolution
- **Persistent Memory**: AI systems increasingly need memory across sessions (Mem0 architecture)
- **Context Management**: Long-term context retention critical for complex multi-step tasks
- **Task Completion Horizons**: AI capability measured by time horizons of completable tasks
- **Automation Trends**: AI task managers focus on intelligent scheduling and automatic prioritization

## Implementation Recommendations

### Core Features
1. **TodoRead**: Get current todo list without parameters
2. **TodoWrite**: Replace entire todo list with new array
3. **TodoAdd**: Convenience method for adding single todos
4. **TodoUpdate**: Update specific todo by ID
5. **TodoComplete**: Mark todo as completed
6. **TodoDelete**: Remove todo by ID
7. **TodoClear**: Clear all todos
8. **TodoStats**: Get statistics about todo distribution

### Technical Architecture
- **Storage**: File-based JSON storage in `.jb6/todos.json`
- **Project Scope**: Each project maintains separate todo list
- **Timestamping**: Track created_at and updated_at timestamps
- **Validation**: Ensure valid status and priority values
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with informative messages

### Integration Points
- **MCP Tools**: Expose as jb6 MCP tools for AI integration
- **CLI Access**: Command-line interface for manual todo management
- **IDE Integration**: Support for VS Code and other development environments
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Maintain todo state between coding sessions
